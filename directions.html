    <li>Scramble the eggs until they are fully cooked. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
    <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the skillet. Stir-fry your choice of vegetables until they are tender.</li>
    <li>Mix the cooked rice with the vegetables. Stir-fry for a few minutes until everything is well combined.</li>
    <li>Return the scrambled eggs to the skillet. Mix everything together and season with soy sauce and scallions.</li>
