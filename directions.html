<!-- Directions of List-->
<ol>
    <li>Start by cooking the rice. It's best to use day-old rice as it has a better texture for frying.</li>
    <li>Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Scramble the eggs until they are fully cooked. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
    <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the skillet. Stir-fry your choice of vegetables until they are tender.</li>
    <li>Mix the cooked rice with the vegetables. Stir-fry for a few minutes until everything is well combined.</li>
    <li>Return the scrambled eggs to the skillet. Mix everything together and season with soy sauce and scallions.</li>
    <li>Cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the rice is heated through.</li>
</ol>
